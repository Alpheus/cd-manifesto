## Definition

A production-like test environment mirrors as closely as possible the architecture and configuration of where the artifact is intended to run. Some examples of this could be as simple as deploying a simple web application to a test environment in the cloud or as complex as deploying firmware changes for a satellite to ground-based hardware for testing in the integrated environment.
